MySql NPM package is used to connect to MySql database and perform queries. 

Inquirer NPM package is used to interact with the user via the command-line by prompts. 

console.table NPM package is used to print MySql rows to the console

# Local Installation
Set up employees database in MySql using schema.sql.  Copy and paste the schema into MySql and execute it to create the database. 

If you wish, seed the database with seeds.sql by copying and pasting into MySql and executing the code.

Run tracker.js in terminal.

Run NPM Install for dependencies.

Follow command-line prompts.

The prompts will automatically add the data you are entering into the MySql employees database.
